### Brief description ###

In this ongoing study, we aim to identify the faces of livestock cattle by using deep learning to free farmers from using radio frequency identification (RFID) ear tags to identify cattle, a practice which is expensive due to sensor, ear tag, and installation labor costs. In the initial stage, we have been provided with videos of cattle taken by phones. Currently, we have about 1,000 videos; whose length varies from 4 seconds to 15 seconds. Images are also extracted from videos. One of the research objectives is to improve the data collection procedures, while another is to demonstrate recognition accuracy, precision, and recall scores comparable to the current state of the field as a proof of concept.
